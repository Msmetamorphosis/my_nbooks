# üìö my_nbooks

**Coursework Archive from Data Science Studies**  
This repository includes selected Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, and assignments created during my college data science coursework a few years back.

While this repo reflects earlier work, it showcases foundational skills in:
- Data analysis and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization techniques
- Python-based data manipulation (using pandas, matplotlib, etc.)
- CSV file handling and basic statistical insights

## üß† Contents

### Notebooks
- `Chapter 2.ipynb`: Introductory notebook covering basic data science operations
- `Chapter 8 Assignment.ipynb`: Later assignment diving deeper into EDA and statistical methods
- `Molnar1.ipynb` & `Molnar_intro.ipynb`: Exercises and summaries based on interpretable ML concepts

### Datasets
- `avocado.csv`: Real-world avocado sales data used for practice in EDA and time series exploration
- `ramen-ratings (2).csv`: Dataset for comparative analysis of international product ratings

### Compressed Archives
- ZIP files contain backups of notebook versions and related files used in coursework

## üîç Purpose

This repo documents my learning journey through core data science principles and reflects my early hands-on experience with:
- Python for data analysis
- Data wrangling techniques
- Applying learned theory to real datasets

Though I‚Äôve significantly advanced in AI, automation, and LLMs since this coursework, I‚Äôve kept this repo public to share my roots and offer insight to others starting out.
